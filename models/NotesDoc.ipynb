    "a = NotesDoc(\"\"\"Designing an Immobilized Metal ion Affinity (IMA) chromatographic process on large scale demands a thorough understanding to be developed regarding the adsorption behaviour of proteins on metal loaded IMA (IMA\u0002M(II)) gels and the characteristic adsorption parameters to be evaluated. This research investigation illustrates the significance of these aspects for the proposed fractionation of chicken egg-white proteins on these gels. Consequently, a systematic investigation of the adsorption characteristics of three chicken egg-white proteins viz., ovalbumin, conalbumin and lysozyme on Cu(II) and Ni(II) loaded IMA gels, iminodiacetate (IDA) and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine (TREN), has been undertaken. These gels differ in their selectivity towards the proteins of interest under the identical sets of experimental conditions. While TREN-Ni(II) was selective only for lysozyme, IDA-Cu(II), IDA-Ni(II) and TREN-Cu(II) showed varying affinities for all the three proteins. The equilibrium and kinetic data were analysed using various theoretical models and adsorption parameters were quantified. On the basis of these investigations, various strategies have been proposed for the efficient large-scale fractionation of chicken egg-white proteins on these gels.\"\"\")"

    "a.update(\"\"\"The present research effort focussed on a thorough analysis of the adsorption behaviour of three egg\u0002white proteins namely, ovalbumin, conalbumin and lysozyme on four IMA-M(II) gels viz., IDA-Cu(II), TREN-Cu(II), IDA-Ni(II) and TREN:Ni(II), with the intent to develop an improved understanding of these interactions for designing large scale IMA separations. The equilibrium adsorption data was analyzed using Langmuir and Langmuir-Freundlich models and the characteristic adsorption parameters were evaluated. The kinetic data was analysed using kinetic rate con\u0002stant model. On the basis of these comparative adsorp\u0002tion studies two strategies were proposed for design\u0002ing efficient fractionation of egg-white proteins using IMAC at large scale. The first approach was based on the differential affinities of three egg-white proteins for a particular IMA gel and the second approach high\u0002lighted the significance of CASMAC scheme. Despite being specific for egg-white proteins, this study has important general implications on the design of any large-scale IMA separation process. The study illus\u0002trated that the characteristic adsorption parameters re\u0002quired for designing an IMA based chromatographic separation process on preparative scale can be esti\u0002mated on the basis of systematically conducted small scale batch experiments. Also, the information derived from this study can be utilized for the process devel\u0002opment using hybrid bioseparation techniques such as metal chelate displacement chromatography and\n",
    "immobilized metal ion-membrane filtration. The ef\u0002ficacy of these parameters in predicting the perfor\u0002mance of an actual separation process is currently under investigation.\"\"\")"
